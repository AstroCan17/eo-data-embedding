Turn massive Earth-observation archives into **queryable, actionable intelligence** with a
pretrained **vision-transformer foundation model**. Embed **Sentinel-2 (optical) + Sentinel-1 (SAR)**
imagery, then do similarity search, few-shot classification, and change detection on the embeddings.

## Results

Real run: **frozen Clay v1.5** (1024-d) embeddings over **2,000 EuroSAT** Sentinel-2 patches
(10 Clay bands), on a Tesla P40. No fine-tuning — a linear probe on top of frozen embeddings,
against a supervised **ResNet-18 trained from scratch** on the same raw pixels and splits.
Protocol: fixed stratified test set (401 samples), k-shot draws from the train pool only,
**mean±std over 5 seeds**.

**Label efficiency** (macro-F1):

| Labels / class | linear probe (frozen Clay) | supervised CNN (from scratch) |
|---|---|---|
| 5 | **0.761 ± 0.027** | 0.547 ± 0.024 |
| 20 | **0.861 ± 0.012** | 0.747 ± 0.020 |
| 50 | **0.895 ± 0.011** | 0.859 ± 0.018 |
| full train pool (1,599) | 0.920 | **0.949** |

→ At **5 labels/class the probe beats the supervised CNN by 21 F1 points**; at 50/class it reaches
97% of its own full-supervision ceiling — with **32× fewer labels**. With *all* labels the CNN wins
(0.949 vs 0.920): frozen embeddings buy **label efficiency**, not supremacy — which is exactly the
foundation-model value proposition.

**Similarity search** (FAISS, no training): **precision@10 = 0.824** vs a 0.103 random-chance baseline
— an **8× lift**. "Find scenes like this" works straight off the frozen embeddings.

**Cross-modal retrieval** — Sentinel-1 SAR ↔ Sentinel-2 optical (SSL4EO-S12, streamed; a SAR tile
retrieves its own optical tile; test = 120 tiles, chance P@1 = 0.008):

| setup | P@1 | P@5 | median rank |
|---|---|---|---|
| frozen Clay embeddings | 0.042 | 0.108 | 32 |
| + learned linear alignment (180 pairs) | 0.142 | 0.400 | 8 |

Honest finding: Clay's *frozen* embeddings are only **weakly cross-modal** (5× chance) — it has no
cross-modal training objective, so SAR and optical of the same place don't coincide. A single
**1024×1024 linear map** learned on 180 pairs lifts SAR→optical retrieval to **17× chance** (median
rank 32→8): the two modalities are *linearly relatable* in Clay's space without joint training.
Within-modal retrieval is far stronger; purpose-built models (DOFA-CLIP) train for cross-modal directly.

**Change detection (OSCD)** — a two-part result. Zero-training cosine distance between the two
dates' embeddings scores **at chance** (ROC-AUC ≈ 0.27–0.49), at *both* global-tile and per-patch
granularity — seasonal/radiometric variation moves unchanged tiles more than building-scale change
moves urban ones, and the literature agrees naive two-date distance is not a working method. But a
**cheap supervised probe on `|e1−e2|`** — logistic regression on frozen embeddings, *no encoder
fine-tuning* — reaches **F1 0.471 / IoU 0.308** at tile level, the same band as *fine-tuned* OSCD
baselines (FC-Siam ≈ 0.45–0.58, SeCo 0.469). Frozen embeddings buy label efficiency here too. The
remaining wall is **phenological seasonality** (vegetation genuinely changes between seasons — not a
colour shift to normalize away), which a two-date dataset can't resolve; the honest fix is a time
series, scoped as explicit follow-on work. Full analysis, four-method table, the two-layer
seasonality argument and next steps in
[`research/06-change-analysis.md`](research/06-change-analysis.md); the cloud-infra story (10
environment fixes, the GPU quota wall, the CPU pivot) is in
[`research/07-engineering-notes.md`](research/07-engineering-notes.md).

> The Clay encoder embeds both modalities (`make clay-smoke`). EuroSAT (optical, single-label) gives
> the clean probe headline; SSL4EO-S12 (streamed S1+S2) gives the cross-modal result above — no 120 GB
> BigEarthNet download needed.

### Known approximations

Deliberate simplifications behind the numbers above — documented in the same spirit as the
S1 GRD-vs-RTC offset note in [`research/05-crossmodal.md`](research/05-crossmodal.md):

- **L1C vs L2A normalization stats.** EuroSAT (and OSCD) are Sentinel-2 **Level-1C**
  (top-of-atmosphere) products, while the Clay band stats in `clay_metadata.py` were derived for
  **L2A** (surface reflectance). The value ranges are close enough that the probe still reaches
  0.92 macro-F1, but it is a known train/inference distribution mismatch, accepted for simplicity.
- **GSD semantics after upsampling.** EuroSAT's 64×64 @ 10 m patches are bilinearly upsampled to
  Clay's 256×256 input while `gsd=10` is passed to the position encoding. After upsampling the
  effective pixel spacing is 2.5 m, but the content is still a 640 m footprint — I keep `gsd=10`
  to describe the sensor, not the resampled grid. A native-64 vs upsampled-256 ablation is open.
- **Class token as *the* embedding.** `embed.py` uses Clay's cls token; mean-pooled patch tokens
  are a known alternative (open question in [`research/02`](research/02-foundation-models.md)) and
  have not been compared yet.
- **Zero `time`/`latlon` metadata.** Clay accepts "unknown" (zeros) for acquisition time and
  location; EuroSAT patches are actually georeferenced, so conditioning on real metadata is an
  available (unrun) ablation.
- **Best-F1 in Phase 5 is an oracle threshold.** The threshold scan runs on the evaluation tiles
  themselves; ROC-AUC is the primary, threshold-free metric. A deployed system would calibrate the
  threshold on held-out scenes.
- **Exact search at demo scale.** FAISS `IndexFlatIP` over ~2k vectors is exact and the right
  choice at this size. What changes at 100M+ vectors — index structure, memory, sharding, the
  store schema — is written up in [`docs/SCALING.md`](docs/SCALING.md).

## Demo

`make app` serves an interactive Gradio search UI (`scripts/phase4_app.py`); `--export` renders a
static montage. Each row: a query tile → its nearest neighbours in Clay-embedding space
(green label = same EuroSAT class as the query, red = different):

## Why

Raw satellite pixels are a commodity. The value is the **intelligence layer** on top:
*"find scenes like this", "what changed here", "classify with almost no labels"*.
This repo demonstrates that layer end to end.

| Capability | Skill it demonstrates |
|---|---|
| ViT foundation-model embeddings | vision transformers, geospatial embeddings |
| Sentinel-1 SAR + Sentinel-2 optical | multi-modal EO / MSI / SAR |
| Frozen backbone + few-shot linear probe | unsupervised / semi-supervised |
| FAISS index over the archive | big-data / ML at scale |
| Embed-once → store → reuse | full model lifecycle, scale |
| Bitemporal Δembedding change maps | defense/intelligence use case — zero-shot distance ≈ chance, but a supervised Δembedding probe matches fine-tuned baselines ([analysis](research/06-change-analysis.md)) |

## Quickstart (Docker — recommended)

No conda, no local env drift. One image runs every phase; CUDA 12.1 covers both the P40 (Pascal)
and T4 (Turing). Requires Docker + (for GPU) the NVIDIA Container Toolkit.

```bash
make build        # build the GPU dev image
make gpu-check    # confirm torch sees the GPU (on an nvidia host)
make sanity       # Phase-0 sanity (CPU-safe)
make smoke        # Phase-0 green-light gate: embed -> parquet -> FAISS -> few-shot probe
make extract      # Phase-1 embedding extraction (needs GPU)
make app          # Phase-4 Gradio demo on :7860 (lightweight CPU image)
make shell        # interactive shell in the GPU dev container
```

CPU-only laptop? Use `make shell-cpu` / `make sanity` / `make smoke` (no GPU reservation).
Code, data, artifacts and the HuggingFace/torch caches are bind-mounted, so downloads and outputs
persist on the host. See [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) and the [`Makefile`](Makefile).

The **smoke** target is the gate to Phase 1: it exercises every downstream code path with a cheap
stand-in encoder, so Phase 1 only swaps in the real foundation model
(see [`research/03-phase0-decisions.md`](research/03-phase0-decisions.md)).

## Background research

Before building, read the decision records in [`research/`](research/) — especially
[`research/01-datasets.md`](research/01-datasets.md), which justifies every dataset choice
(specs, licenses, and which phase it serves) against the project's capability goals. The change-
detection write-up [`research/06-change-analysis.md`](research/06-change-analysis.md) is the most
detailed result (honest negative + supervised probe + where it stops and why), and
[`research/07-engineering-notes.md`](research/07-engineering-notes.md) records the cloud-infra
debugging behind getting it to run.
